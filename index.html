    <h1>Privacy Policy for Nawa Chat</h1>
    <p><em>Last Updated: 04/04/2024</em></p>

    Here‚Äôs a **revised privacy policy** tailored to your current app state (1:1 chat only, no data collection). It‚Äôs
    transparent, minimalist, and future-proofed for updates:

    ---

    # **Privacy Policy for Nawa Chat**
    *Last Updated: 04/04/2024*
    *(Note: This policy applies to the current beta version of Nawa Chat, which is under active development.)*

    ---

    ### **1. Summary**
    Nawa Chat is designed to prioritize your privacy. **In its current beta stage**, the app:
    - Supports **1:1 text chats only** (no group chats, calls, or file sharing yet).
    - **Does not collect, store, or share** any personal data or usage information.
    - **Cannot access your messages**, which are encrypted locally on your device.

    ---

    ### **2. Data We Do NOT Collect**
    **In this version of Nawa Chat**:
    - **No account required**: You use the app anonymously without providing an email, phone number, or username.
    - **No message storage**: Chats exist only on your device and the recipient‚Äôs device. We have no servers to store
    them.
    - **No analytics or tracking**: We don‚Äôt use cookies, SDKs, or third-party tools to monitor your activity.

    ---

    ### **3. Technical Safeguards**
    - **Local encryption**: Messages are encrypted on your device before being sent to the recipient.
    - **No metadata**: We don‚Äôt log timestamps, IP addresses, or device identifiers.
    - **Open development**: As we add features, we‚Äôll update this policy and prioritize privacy-first design.

    ---

    ### **4. Your Control**
    - **Delete chats**: Remove conversations permanently via the in-app delete button (erased from both devices).
    - **No permissions required**: The app doesn‚Äôt request access to your contacts, camera, microphone, or location.

    ---

    ### **5. Future Updates**
    As we expand features (e.g., group chats, file sharing), we will:
    - Update this policy clearly and in advance.
    - Maintain a **strict ‚Äúno unnecessary data collection‚Äù rule**.
    - Continue using end-to-end encryption for new features.

    ### **6. Questions?**
    Contact us at **nawaappleb@gmail.com** for clarifications.

    ---

    ### **Why This Works**
    1. **Honesty about beta status**: Manages expectations for early testers.
    2. **No legalese**: Plain language aligns with your ‚Äúno hidden tricks‚Äù ethos.
    3. **Future-proofing**: Leaves room for feature additions without needing immediate policy rewrites.
    4. **Compliance**: Meets Google Play‚Äôs minimum requirements for privacy policies.

    ---

    ### **Next Steps**
    - Replace **04/04/2024** and **nawaappleb@gmail.com**.
    - Host this policy on a public URL (e.g., GitHub Pages, your website).
    - Link to it in your app‚Äôs settings/Play Store listing.
